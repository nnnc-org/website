The NNNC provides a variety of services to its members that can be broadly categorized into the following areas: 
* Group Purchasing
* Network Services
* Custom Development
* Technology Consulting / Support

Below is a list of some of the services that we provide to our member schools.

## Internet Bandwidth

The NNNC was originally founded back in the year 2000 to help improve Internet bandwidth to member schools while containing costs, and still continues with this original goal. We currently bulk purchase Internet bandwidth from Network Nebraska and distribute it back to our schools. This allows us to provide high-speed Internet access to our schools at a fraction of the cost of what they would pay if they were to purchase it on their own.

## Central Firewall

We provide a highly available, centrally managed firewall solution to our member schools. This allows us to provide a secure Internet connection to our districts to help protect them from the ever-growing number of cyber threats.

## Nebraska Connect

Nebraska Connect is a Single Sign On sytem that enables schools and ESU’s to easily connect up to the Nebraska Cloud system using the Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services technology. Additionally, assistive technologies have been created to help manage and maintain the infrastructure necessary to keep the burden away from the schools and ESU’s.

## Monitoring

The NNNC provides various monitoring and logging services for our members. This includes items like monitoring of transport connections and providing a centralized logging platform for district firewalls.

## Custom Development

The NNNC staff has experience in developing custom software solutions to meet the unique needs of our member schools. This includes items like custom web applications, data integrations, and automation scripts.
