<br/>

This regional partnership began in the fall of 2000 with the purpose of improving Internet bandwidth to member schools while containing costs. The NNNC is a consortium of the 5 Educational Service Units (ESUs) in northeast Nebraska - 1, 2, 7, 8 and 17. The NNNC now provides Internet access, network services, and technology support to its member ESUs and districts.

The NNNC currently has one full time employee, the Technology Analyst. However, every member ESU contributes to the success of the NNNC via the collaborative efforts from each individual technology department.
